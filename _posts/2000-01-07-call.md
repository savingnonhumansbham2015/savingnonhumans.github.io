As the conference will be interdisciplinary, we especially welcome abstracts from philosophy, political sciences, law, and sociology.

As well as the above, some topics might include (though any other topic is welcomed):

- Humans as Animals
- The Importance speciesism/human chauvinism (etc) takes on with this change
- Rights
- Justice
- Activism

Proposals for papers should be at maximum 500 words. Proposals should not indicate the authorâ€™s name as the selection process will be blind.

Accompanying the abstract should be a short biography, detailing status, name, institution, contact information, and the title of the abstract/proposed paper.

Abstracts should be sent in .doc, .docx, or .pdf format.

The EXTENDED closing date for abstract submission is: 27th February 2015

Successful authors will be notified by: 2nd March 2015

Abstracts must be sent electronically to: savingnonhumansbham2015@gmail.com

The successful papers will be allocated 30 minutes each for presentation.
